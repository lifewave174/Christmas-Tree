<h3>Instructions:</h3>

1. In order to display a Christmas Tree with ASCII art in your browser, please right-click and open the following link in a 'new tab': https://github.com/lifewave174/Christmas-Tree/blob/master/christmas%20tree.html 

2. Copy the text between the "<script>...</script>" tags. Please do not copy the script tags themselves! your copied selection should start from "//define height...." and end at "...document.write("I</br>");};". The selection should be just after and before the opening (<script>) and ending (</script>) tags. In order to copy the text, you need to select it with your cursor and then right click and choose 'Copy.'

3. Open the console in the browser of your choice. Preferably in a new tab. See above on how to open the console. 

4. Right click and paste your copied selection in the console. Do not press enter!

5. Before you press enter, define the height you want for your christmas tree. The height is the number in the 'var height' variable. For example, if you want your height to be 7, then change the 'var height=5' in your selection to 'var height=7'

6. If you want a star in your pyramid, you need to keep the 'var star=true' line. If you do not want a star, then change the 'var star=true' line to 'var star=false.' Make sure that you do not delete the ';' after the lines. All punctuation marks need to remain as they are in order for it to work.

7. Once you have made your desired height and star changes to the "var height=5" and "var star=true" lines, press enter on your keyboard. Do not press enter before that. If you do end up pressing enter, please refresh your browser or close it and open it again, and then follow the steps from points 6. to 9. 

8. After you press enter, your Christmas tree will show up in the browser! Voila! Good job!
